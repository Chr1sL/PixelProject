# PixelProject

This pixel prints the temperature of San Francisco under the running video and depending on the temperature displays either a snowing or sunny background. The pixel also tracks the user's movements and creates a mask on top of their face that is either 
blue or orange tinted based on the temperature. There is also a button that displays the description of how the program works
and a color slider that is fun to play with, but has no real purpose. This filter works best in a well-lit area where the face is not covered from the view of the camera.
